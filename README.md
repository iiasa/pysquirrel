## Overview

**pysquirrel** is a Python package designed to work with NUTS administrative divisions.

The current NUTS version is valid from 1 January 2024.

## Background

From the [Eurostat website](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/overview)

The [NUTS
classification](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Nomenclature_of_territorial_units_for_statistics_(NUTS))
(Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics) is a geographical nomenclature subdividing the economic territory of the European Union (EU) into regions at three different levels (NUTS 1, 2 and 3 respectively, moving from larger to smaller territorial units). Above NUTS 1, there is the 'national' level of the Member States.

NUTS is used for:

- collecting, developing and harmonising European regional statistics
- carrying out socio-economic analyses of the regions
- framing of EU regional policies

## Usage

**pysquirrel** allows searching the list of all territorial units by specifying the 
parameters and the values to search as shown below:

```python
>>> import pysquirrel

>>> pysquirrel.nuts.get(country_code="AT")  # gets all regions in Austria

>>> pysquirrel.nuts.get(level=3)  # gets all NUTS3 regions

>>> pysquirrel.nuts.get(country_code="AT", level=3)  # gets all NUTS3 regions in Austria
```

Each Region object consists of five attributes:
- a NUTS code (e.g.: AT127)
- a country code
- a label (the full region name)
- a NUTS level (1, 2 or 3)
- a parent code (corresponding to the NUTS parent region)
